# REPRODUCIBILITY GUIDELINES

This repository accompanies a paper to facilitate its reproducibility: "Positional Bias in Long-Document Ranking: Impact, Assessment, and Mitigation".

The MS MARCO FarRelevant collection can be downloaded using [this link](https://pub-31b207e206fc448aa58401dc893868ae.r2.dev/msmarco_synthetic_longdoc_2024-01-23.tar.bz2). The format of the dataset is described [here](MSMARCO_FarRelevant.md). Once the paper is accepted we will upload the collection to HuggingFace datasets and provide detailed instructions on using software.
